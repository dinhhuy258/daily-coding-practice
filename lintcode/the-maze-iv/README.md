Give you a map where ‘S’ indicates the starting point and 'T' indicates the ending point. ‘#’ means that the wall is unable to pass, and '.’ means that the road can take a minute to pass. Please find the minimum time it takes to get from the start point to the end point. If the end point cannot be reached, please output -1.

**Example:**
```
 Input:map=[['S','.'],
            ['#','T']]

 Output:t=2
```
