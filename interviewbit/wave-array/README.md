Given an array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array and return it, 
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that `a1 >= a2 <= a3 >= a4 <= a5.....`

**Example:**
```
 Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
 Output: [2, 1, 4, 3]
```

**Note::**

If there are multiple answers possible, return the one thats lexicographically smallest.
So, in example case, you will return `[2, 1, 4, 3]`
