Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.
Return the sum of the three integers.

**Example:**
```
 S = {-1 2 1 -4}
 target = 1

 The sum that is closest to the target is 2 (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2)
```

**Note::**

Assume that there will only be one solution
