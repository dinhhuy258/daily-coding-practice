Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem

**Example 1:**
```
 Input : 
           1
          / \
         2   3
 
 Return : True or 1 
```

**Example 2:**
```
 Input: 
          3
         /
        2
       /
      1
 
 Return : False or 0 
          Because for the root node, left subtree has depth 2 and right subtree has depth 0. 
          Difference = 2 > 1.
```
