Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```
