[https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-square/](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-square/)

Given a string containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', write a function to check whether this string is valid. We define the validity of a string by these rules:

The coordinate (x,y) of a point is represented by an integer array with two integers.

**Example:**
```
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
Output: True
```

Note:
1. All the input integers are in the range [-10000, 10000].
2. A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
3. Input points have no order.
