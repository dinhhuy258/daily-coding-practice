Given a triangle, find the minimum path sum from top to bottom. Each step you may move to adjacent numbers on the row below.

**Example:**
```
Input:
[
     [2],
    [3,4],
   [6,5,7],
  [4,1,8,3]
]

Output: 11 (2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11)
```

**Note:**

Bonus point if you are able to do this using only O(n) extra space, where n is the total number of rows in the triangle.
