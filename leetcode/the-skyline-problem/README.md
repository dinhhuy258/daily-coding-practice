[https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-skyline-problem/)

A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are **given the locations and height of all the buildings** as shown on a cityscape photo, write a program to **output the skyline** formed by these buildings collectively.

The geometric information of each building is represented by a triplet of integers `[Li, Ri, Hi]`, where `Li` and `Ri` are the x coordinates of the left and right edge of the ith building, respectively, and `Hi` is its height. It is guaranteed that `0 ≤ Li, Ri ≤ INT_MAX`, `0 < Hi ≤ INT_MAX`, and `Ri - Li > 0`. You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height 0.

**Example:**
```
 Input: [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
 Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
```
**Notes:**
* The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range `[0, 10000]`.
* The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position `Li`.
* The output list must be sorted by the x position.
* There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]`
